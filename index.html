                    <p class="testimonial-light">I received a job offer mid-course, 
                    and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
                    I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-cont-light">“ I was an EMT for many years before 
                    I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                     and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                     The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                     Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                     working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup." </p>

                    “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
                    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. 
                    The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

                    Highly recommended!</p>
                    <p class="testimonial-cont-dark"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, 
                    I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals 
                    who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                    In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! </p>
